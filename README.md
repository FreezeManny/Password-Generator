# Password Generator

A simple Python based Password generator that runs locally on your device.
It generates a password and automatically copies it to your clipboard.

To run it with Linux you need to download the fantastic CustomTkinter Library and a Python 3.x release. For the .exe you do not need that and can just run the .exe

Compiled with the Auto-py-to-exe for a Windows EXE.
